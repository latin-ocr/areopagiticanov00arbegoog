Court of Parlament, or wanting such accesse

in a private condition, write that which they

and the thought of whom it hath recourse to, hath got
the power within me to a paffion, farre more welcome

the liberty which wee can hope, that no grievance ever
should arise in the Commonwealth, that let no man in
this World expe& 3 but when complaints are freely heard,
deeply confider'd, and speedily reform'd, then is the
utmost bound os civill liberty attain’d‚ that wife men
