36 AREOPAGJTJCA.

In Athens where Books and Wits were ever bufier
then in any other part of Greece, I find but only two
sorts of writings which the Magistrate car'd to take no·
tice of 3 those either blasphemous and Atheisticall, or
Libellous. Thus the Books of Protagoras were by the
Judges of A reopagus commanded to be burnt, and him-
selfe banisht the territory for a discourse begun with his
confeffing not to know whether there were gods, or
wlzetlzer not .· And against defaming‚ it was decreed that
none should he traduc'd by name, as was the manner
of Vetus Comoedia, whereby we may guesse how they
censur'd libelling: And this course was quick enough,
as Cicero writes, to quell both the desperate wits of
other Atheists, and the open way of defaming‚ as the
event shew'd. Of other sects and opinions though
tending to voluptuousneffe, and the denying of divine
providence they tooke no heed. Therefore we do not
read that either Epicurus, or that libertine school of
Cyrene, or what the C ynick impudence utter’d, was ever
question'd by the Laws, N either is it recorded that the
writings of those old Comedians were supprest‚ though
the acting of them were forbid 3 and that Plato com-
mended the reading of A rssophanes the loosest of them

, all, to his royall scholler Dionyfius, is commonly known,

and may be excus'd, if holy Chrysostome, as is reported,
nightly studied so much the farne Author and had the
art to cleanse a scurrilous vehemence into the still of a
rousrng Sermon. T hat other leading City of (ἕνεκα,
Lacedaemon,cons1dering that Lycurgus their Law· ·giver

was so addicted to elegant learning, as to have been i
the first that brought out of Ionia the scatter'd workes
of Homer, and sent the Poet Thales from Creet to pre-
pare and mollifie the Spartan surlinesse with his smooth
songs and odeS, the better to plant among them law
and civility, it is to be wonder'd how museless and un-
bookissi they were, minding nought but the feats of
Warre. There needed no licencing of Books among
them for they dissik’d all, but their owne Laconide Apa
tlzegms, and took a ssight occafion to ehase Archilochus
