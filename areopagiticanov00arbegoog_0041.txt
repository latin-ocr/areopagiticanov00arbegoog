the Church and Commonwealth‚ to have a vigilant eye
how Bookes demeane themselves as well as men 3 and
thereafter to confine, imprison, and do sharpest justice
on them as malefactors: For Books are not absolutely
dead thingS, but doe contain a potencie os life in them
to be as active as that soule was whose progeny they are 3

Ι know they are as lively, and as vigoroussy produCtive, ,
as those fabulous Dragons teeth3 and being sown up
and down, may chance to spring up armed men. And
yet on the other hand unleffe warinesse be us’d‚ as good
almost kill a Man as kill a good Book3 who kil'ls a Man
kills a reasonable creature, Gods Image3 but hee who
destroyes 'a good Booke, kills reason it selfe‚ kills the
Image of God, as it were in the eye. Manya man lives
a burden to the Easth· , but a good Booke is the pretious
life-blood of a master spirit, imbalm'd and treasur'd up
on purpose to a life beyond lise. ’Tis true, no age can
restore a life, whereof perhaps there is no great losse3
and revolutions of ages doe not oft recover the losse os
a rejected truth, for the want of which whole N ations
fare the worse. We should be wary therefore what per·
secution we raise against the living labours of publick
men, how we spill that season’d life of man preserv'd
and stor’d up in Books 3 since we see a kinde of homicide
may be thus committed, sometimes a martyrdome, and
isit extend to the whole impression, a kinde of massacre‚
whereof the execution ends notin the ssaying of an ele-
mentall life, but strikes at that ethereall and fist effence,
the breath os reason it selfe, ssaies an immortality rather
then a life. But lest I should be condemn’d of intro-
ducing licence, while I oppose Licencing, I refuse not
the paines to be so much Historicall, as will serve to
shew what hath been done by ancient and famous Com-
monwealths, against this disorder, till the very time that
this proj ec‘t of licencing crept out os the Inqmfftion, was
catcht up by our PrelateS, and hath caught some os our
PresbyterS.
