rous vertue destin'd to become great and honourable
in these latter ages. Methinks I see in my mind a
noble and puifl'ant Nation roufing herself like a strong
man after sseep,v and shaking her invincible locks:
Methinke Ι see her as an Eagle muing her mighty
youth, and kindling her undazl'd eyes at the full mid-
