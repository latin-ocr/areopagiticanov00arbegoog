And now the time in speciall rs, by priviledge tol
wrtie and speak what may help to the furder discus}
fing of matters in agitation. The Temple of sanus with
his two controvetfltl faces might now not unngnifi-
cantly be set open. And though all the windes of
doctrin were let loose to play upon the earth, so Truth
be in the field, we do injurioussy by licencing and
prohibiting to misdoubt her strength. Let her and
F alshood grapple; who ever knew Truth put to the
worS, in a free and open encounter. Her confuting}
is the best and surest suppresssng. He who hears what
praying there 1s for light and clearer knowledge to be
sent down among us, would think of other matters to
be constituted beyond the discipline of Geneva, sram’d
and fabric't already to our hands. Yet when the new
light which we beg for shines in upon uS, there be who
envy, and oppose, if it come not first in at their case·
ments, What a collufion is this; whenas we are ex- 1
horted by the wife man to use diligence, to seek sor
wisdom as fhr lzidd'n treasures early and late, that
another order shall enj0yn us to know nothing but by
statute. When a man hath bin labouring the hardest ¹
labour in the deep mines of knowledge, hath furnisht
out his findings in all their equipage, drawn forth his
reasons as it were a battell raung’d, scatter’d and
defeated all obJections in his way, calls out his adver-
sary into the plain, offers him the advantage of wind
and sun, if he please ; only that he may try the matter
by dint of argument, for his opponents then to sculk,
to lay ambushmentS, to keep a narrow bridge of licen·
cing where the challenger should paffe, though it be
valour anough in shouldiership, is but weaknes and
cowardise in the wars of Truth. For who knows not
that Truth is strong next to the Almighty; she needs
no policieS, no strategems, no licencings to make her
victorious, those are the ‘shifts and the defences that
error uses against her power: give her but room, and
do not bind her when she sseepS, sor then she speaks
not true, as the old Prcteus did. who spake oracles
