6⁸ AREOPAGITICA.

Lords and Commons of England, consider what
Nation it is wherof ye are, and wherof ye are the
governours: a Nation not ssow and dull, but osa quick‚
ingenious», and piercing spirit, acute to invent, suttle
and finewy to discourS, not beneath the reach of any
point the highest that human capacity can soar to.
Therefore the studies of learning in her deepest Sci-
ences have bin so ancient, and so eminent among uS‚
that Writers of good antiquity, and ablest judgement have
bin perswaded that ev'n the school of Pythagoras, and
the Perfian wisdom took beginning from the old Philo-
sophy of this Iland. And that wise and civill Roman,
Julius Agricola, who govern’d once here for Caesar, pre-

that out of her as out of Sion should be proclam’d and
founded sorth the first tidings and trumpet of Reforma-
tion to all Europ. And had it not bin the obstinat per·
versnes of 'our Prelats against the divine and admirable
spirit of chqu, to suppresse him as a schismatic and
innovator, perhaps neither the BolzemianH uffiand serom,
no nor the name of Lutlzer‚ or os Calvin had bin ever
known: the glory ofreforming all our neighbours had bin
compleatly ourS. But now, as our obdurat Clergy have
with violence demean’d the matter, we are become
hitherto the latest and the backwardest SchollerS, of whom
God offer'd to have made us the teacherS. Now once
