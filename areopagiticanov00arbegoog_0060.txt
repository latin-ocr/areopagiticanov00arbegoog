order still would be but fruitlesse and defthive to
that end whereto ye meant it. If to prevent see'ts and
schismS, who is so unread or so uncatechis’d in story,
that hath not heard of many [εξὶ5 refusing books as a
hindrance, and preserving their do<strine unmixt for
many ageS, only by unwritt’n traditionS. The Christian}
saith, for that was once a schism, is not unknown to have?
spread all overAfia, ere any Gospel or Epistle was seen in*
writing. If the amendment of manners be aym’d at, look}
into Italy and Spain, whether those places be one scruple
the better, the honestet, the wiser, the chaster,fince all the'
inquifitionall rigor that hath bin executed upon bookS.
Another reason, whereby to make it plain that this
‘order will misse the end it feekS, consider by the quality
which ought to be in every licencer. It cannot be den y'd
¹{but that he who is made judge to fit upon the birth, or}
·death of books whether they may be wasted into this*
world, or not, had need to be a man above the common f
«measure, both studiouS, learned, and judicious3 there
may be else no mean mistakes in the censure of what]
sis paffable or not3 which is also no mean injury. Π
he be os such worth as behoovs him, there cannot be
a more tedious and unpleasmg Journey· -,work a greater
loffe of time levied upon his head, then to be made the
perpetuall reader of unchosen books and pamphlets
ostimes huge volumeS. There 15 no book that 1s accept
able unlesse at certain seasons; but to be enjoyn ’d the
reading of that at all timeS‚ and 1n a hand scars legible
whereof three pages would not down at any time in the g
fairest Print, is an impofition which I cannot beleeve
how he that values time, and his own studieS, or is but ³
of a senfible nostrill should be able to endure. In this ὲ
one thing I crave leave of the present licencers to be ¹
pardon'd for so thinking: who doublesse took this office ἒ
up, looking on it through their obedience to the Par· ξ
lament, whose command perhaps made all things seem
eafie and unlaborious to them3 but that this short triall ’
hath wearied them out already, their own expreflions and ²
excuses to them who make so many J'ourneys to sollicit
