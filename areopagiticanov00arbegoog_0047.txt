ever inquir’d. Till then Books were ever as freely ad-
mitted into use World as any other birth ; the iffue of
the brain was no more stifl’d then the issue of the wonib:
no envious suno sate cross-leg’d over the nativity of any
mans intellectual off spring: but if it prov'd a Monster‚
who denies, but that it was justly burnt, or sunk in the
Sea. But that a Book in wors condition then a peccant
soul, should be to stand before a Jury cre it be borne
to the World, and undergo yet in darknesse the judge-
ment of Radamantlz and his Colleagues‚ ere it can passe
the serry backward into light, was never heard before,
till that mysterious iniquity provokt and troubl’d at the
first entrance of Reformation, fought out new limbo’s
and new hells wherein they might include our Books
also within the number of their damned. And this was

prefl‘ors of men were the first who tooke it up, and to
no other purpose but to Obstru& and hinder the first
approach of Reformation ; I am of those who beleeve,
it will be a harder alchymy then Lullius ever knew,
to sublimat any good use out of such an invention.
Yet this only is what I request to gain srom this reason,
that it may be held a dangerous and suspicious fruit,
as certainly it deserveS, for the tree that bore it, untill
Ι can dissect one by one the properties it has. But I
have first to finish as was propounded, what is to he
