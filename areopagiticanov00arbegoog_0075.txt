AREOPA GITICA. 69

ing of Reformation it sels: what does he then but
reveal Himself to his servantS, and as his manner is,
first to his English-men ; I say as his manner is, first
to uS, though we mark not the method os his eounseIS,
and are unworthy. Behold now this vast City 3 a City
of refuge, the manfion house of liberty, encompast and
surrounded with his plote6tion ; the shop of warre hath
not there more anvils and hammers waking‚ tosashion
out the plates and instruments of armed Justice in
desence of beleaguer’d Truth, then there be‘ pens and
heads there, fitting by their studious lamps, muling,
searching‚ revolving new notions and idea's wherewith
to present, as with their homage and their fealty the
approaching Reformation: others as fast reading, trying

sect and schism, we wrong the earnest and zealous thirst
after knowledge and understanding which God hath
stirr'd up in this City. What some lament of, we rather
should rejoyce at, should rather praise this pious sor-
wardnes among men, to reaffume the ill deputed care
of their Religion into their own hands again. A little
generous prudence, a little forbearance of one another,
and forn grain of charity might win all these diligences
to Joyn, and unite in one general] and brotherly search
after Truth ; could we but sorgoe this PrelatiCall tradi-
tion of crowding free consciences and Christian liberties
into canons and precepts of men. I doubt not, if some
great and worthy stranger should come among υς, wise
