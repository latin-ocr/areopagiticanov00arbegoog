AREOPA GITICA. 75

only when he was caught and bound, but then rather
she turns herself into all shapes, except her own, and
perhaps tunes her voice according to the time, as
Micaialz did before Ahab, untill she be adjur'd into
her own likeneS. Yet is it not impossible that she may
have more shapes then one. What else is all that rank
of things indifferent, wherein Truth may be on this fide,
or on the other, without being unlike her sels. What
but a vain shadow else is the abolition of those ordi-
nances, that hand wn'ting nayl’d to tlte crqffe, what
great purchase is this Christian liberty which Paul so
often boasts of. His dOCtrine is, that he who eats or

We doe not see that while we still affect by all means
a rigid externall formality, we may as soon fall again
into a groffe conforming stupidity, a stark and dead
congealment of wood and hay and stubble forc't and
frozen together, which is more to the sudden degene-
rating of a Church then many ficbdicltotomies os petty
schisms· Not that I can think well of every light sepa-
ration, or that all in a Church is to be expected gold
andfilver andpretzbusstones: it is not possible for man
to sever the wheat from the tareS, the good fifh from
the other srie ; that must be the Angels Ministery at the
end of mortall things. Yet if all cannot be of one mind,
