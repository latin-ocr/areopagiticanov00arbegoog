were 1 the chooser, a dram of well doing should be pre-
serr d before many times as much the forcible hindrance
,of evill-doing. For God fure esteems the growth and
÷comp1eating of one vertuous person, more then the
restraint of ten vitiouS. And albeit what ever thing we
hear or see,s1tting,walking, travelling, or conversmg
may be fitly call’ d our book, and rs of the same effe&

were only bookS, it appears that this order hitherto is
far insufficient to the end which it intendS. Do we not
see, not once or ostner, but weekly that continu'd Court-

libell against the Parlament and City, Printed, as the
wet sheets can witneS, and dispers’t among us for all

are partly usefull and excellent, partly culpable and
pernicious 3 this work will ask as many more officials
to make expurgations and expunetions, that the Com-
monwealth of learning be not damnify'd. In fine, when

the multitude of books encrease upon their hands, ye
must be fain t'o catalogue all those Printers who are

found frequently offending, and forbidd the importation

χ this your order may be εκειὲὶ, and not deficient, ye must

reform it perfeetly according to the model os Trent and

Sevil, which I know ye abhorre to doe. Yet though
