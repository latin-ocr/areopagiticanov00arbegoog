why our fage and serious Poet Spencer, whom Ι dan
be known to think a better teacher then Scotus oi
Aquinas, describing true temperance under the persor
of Guion, brings him in with his palmer through th‹
cave of Mammon, and the bowr of earthly blisse thal
he might see and know, and yet abstain. Since there·
fore the knowledge and survay of vice is in this world
so necessary to the constituting of human vertue, and
the scanning of error to the confirmation of truth, how
can we more safely, and with lesse danger scout into
the regions of fin and falfity then by reading all man-

this is the benefit which may be had of books promis·
