tongues! when God gave him reason, he gave him free
dom to choose‚ for reason is but choofing3 he had bit
else a meer artificiall Adam, such an Adam as he is it
the motionS. We our selves esteem not of that obedi
enee, or love, or gift, which is of force: God therefore
lest him free, set before him a provoking objess, eve1
almost in his eyes herein confisted his merit, herein the
right of his reward, the praise of his abstinence. Where-
fore did he creat paffions within us, pleasures round
about uS‚ but that these rightly temper'd are the very
ingredients of vertu i· They are not skilfull considerem
of human thingS, who imagin to remove sin by remov-
ing the matter of sin ; for, besides that it is a huge heap
increasmg under the very aet of diministiing though

Why should we then affeci: a rigor contrary to the man·

those means, which books freely permitted are, both
to the triall of vertue, and the exercise of truth. It
would be better done to learn that the law must nee

be frivolous which goes to restrain thingS, uncertain

and yet equally working to good, and to evill. An
