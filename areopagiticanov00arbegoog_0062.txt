serular‚ to come under the fescu of an Imprimatur? if
serious and elaborat writingS, as if they were no more
then the theam of a Grammar lad under his Pedagogue
must not be utter'd without the cursory eyes of a tem-
porizing and extemporizing licencer. He who is not
trusted with his own astions, his drift not being known
to be evill, and standing to the hazard of law and penalty,
has no great argument to think himself reputed in the
Commonwealth wherein he was born, for other then a
sool or a foreiner. When a man writes to the world,
he summons up all his reason and deliberation to affist
him; he searcheS, meditats, is industriouS, and likely
consults and conferrs with his judicious friends ς after
all which done he takes himself to be inform’d in what Ἴ
he writes, as well as any that writ before him; if in this
the most consummat a& of his fidelity and ripeneffe, no
years, no industry, no former proof of his abilities can
bring him to that state of maturity, as not to be still
mistrusted and suspefted, unlefl‘e he carry all his con·
fiderat diligence, all his midnight watchings,and expence
of Palladian oyl‚ to the hasty view of an unleasur’d
licencer, perhaps much his younger, perhaps far his in·
seriour in judgement, perhaps one who never knew the
labour of book-writing, and if he be not repulit, or
ssighted, must appear in Print like a punie with his
guardian, and his censors hand on the back of his title
to be his bayl and surety, that he is no idiot, or seducet,
it cannot be but a dissionor and derogation to the au thor,
to the book, to the priviledge and dignity of Learning.
And what if the author shall be one so copious of fancie,
as to have many things well worth the adding, come
into his mind after licencing, while the book is yet under
the Presse, which not seldom happ'ns to the best and
diligentest writers; and that perhaps a dozen times in
one book. The Printer dares not go beyond his licenc’t
copy 3 so often then must the author trudge to his leav-
giver, that those his new insertions may be viewd 3 and
many a jaunt will be made, ere that licencer, for it must
be the same man, can either be found, or found at leisure 3
