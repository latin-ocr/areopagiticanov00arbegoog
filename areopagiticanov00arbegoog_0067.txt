respected by ye, loaded me with entreaties and per-
swafionS, that I would not despair to lay together that
which just reason should bring into my mind, toward
the removal of an undeserved thraldom upon lerning.
That this is not therefore the disburdning of a partic-
ular fancie, but the common grievance of all those
who had p'repar'd their minds and studies above the
vulgar pitch to advance truth in otherS, and from others

name I shall for neither friend nor soe conceal what
the generall murmur is 3 that if it corne to inquifitioning

both these over worthiest and excellentest books and
ablest authors that write thern. This is not, Yee
Covenants and Protestations that we have made, this
is not to put down Prelaty, this is but to chop an
Episcopacy, this is but to transsate the Palace Metro-
politan from one kind of dominion into another, this
is but an old cannonicall ssight of commuting our
penanee. To startle thus betimes at a meer unlicenc’t
