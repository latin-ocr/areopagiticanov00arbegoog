to di'fcern the mould and temper os a people, and how
to govern it, observing the high hopes and aim5‚ the
diligent alacrity of our extended thoughts and reason-
ings in the pursuance of truth and freedom, but that he
would cry out as Pir-rhus did, admiring the Roman
docility and courage, if such were my Epirots, I would
not despair the greatest defign that could be attempted
'to make a Church or Kingdom happy. Yet these are
the men cry‘d out against sor schismaticks and seetaries3
as if, while the Temple os the Lord was building, some
cutting, some squating the marble, others hewing the
cedar-S, there should be a sort ofirrationall men who could
not consider there must be many schisms and many dis-
setffions made in the quan-y and in the timber, ere the
house os God can be built. And when every stone is laid
artfully together, it cannot be united into a continuity, it
can but be contiguous in this world ; neither can every
peeee of the building be of one form 3 nay rather the
perfeetion consists in this, that out of many moderat
varieties and brotherly dissimilitudes that are not
vastly disproportionall arises the goodly and the grace-
sull symmetry that commends the whole pile and struc-
ture. Let us therefore be more considerat builderS‚
more wise in spirituall architetffture, when great refor-
mation is expe6ted. For now the time seems come,
wherein Moses the great Prophet may fit in heav'n re-
joycing to see that memorable and glorious with os his
fulfill'd, when not only our sev’nty ElderS, but all the
Lords people are become Prophets. No marvell then
though some men, and some good men too perhaps»,

but young in goodnefl‘e, as sosttua then waS, envy them.

They fret, and out of their own weaknes are in agony‚

lest those divifions and subdivifions will undoe us. The
adversarie again applaudS‚ and waits the hour, when

they have brancht themselves out, saith he, small anough
into parties and partitionS, then will be our time. F ool!
he sees not the firm root, out of which we all grow,

though into branches: nor w1ll beware untill hee see
our small divided maniples cutting through at every angle
