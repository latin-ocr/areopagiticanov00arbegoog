AREOPAGITJCA. 33

gredound to the lustre of your milde and equali Govern-
ment, when as private persons are hereby animated to
a‚thinke ye better pleas'd with publick advice, then other
ostatists have been delighted heretofore with publicke
rflattery. And men will then see what difference there
is between the magnanimity of a trienniall Parlament‚
{and that jealous hautinesse os Prelates and cabin Coun·
sellours that usurpt os late, when as they shall observe
