against that opinion in his own writings. Nor was the
Satyricall ssiarpnesse, or naked plainnes of Lucilius, or
Catullus, or Flaccus, by any order prohibited. And for
matters os State, the story of Titius Livius, though it
extoll’d that part which Pompey held, was not therefore
supprest by OHavtus Caesar of the other FaCtion. But
