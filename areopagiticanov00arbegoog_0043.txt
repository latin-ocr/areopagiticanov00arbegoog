out of their City, perhaps for compofing in a higher
straine then their owne souldierly ballats and roundels
could reach to: Or if it were for his broad verseS, they
were not therein so cautious, but they were as dissolute
in their promiscuous conversmg3 whence Euripides
affirmes in Andromache, that their women were all un-
chaste. Thus much may give us light after what sort '
Bookes were prohibited among the Greeks. The Ro-
mans also for many ages train’d up only to a military

knew of learning little but what their twelve TableS‚
