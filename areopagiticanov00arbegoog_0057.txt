Mpzyors. Next‚ what more Nationall corruption, for
‚vhieh England hears ill abroad‚ then houshold gluttony3
cvho shall be the redtors of our daily rioting ? and what
hall be done to inhibit the multitudes that frequent
those houses where drunk’nes is sold and harbour’d?
Dur garments also should be reserr’d to the licencing os
some more sober work-masters to see them cut· into a
lesse wanton garb. Who shall regulat all the mixt con—
versation os our youth, male and female together, as is
the fastiion of this Country, who shall still appoint what
shall be discours’d‚ what presum'd‚ and no furder ?
