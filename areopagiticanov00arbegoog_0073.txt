all, Lords and Commoris„ nor ever ffiall' doe, till her
Masters second comming; he 111311 bring together every
joynt and member, and 111311 mould them into an im·
mortall feature of loveliness and perfectiori. Suffer not
these licencing prohibitions to stand at every place of
opportunity forbidding and disturbing them that con-

tinue seeking‚ that continue to do our obsequies to
the torn body of our martyr’d Saint. We boast our
light, but if we look not wisely on the Sun it sels, it
smites us into darkneS. Who can discem those planets
that are ost Combrgst, and those stars of brightest mag-

nitude that rise and set with the Suu, untill the opposite
motion of their orbs bring thern to such a place in the
firmament‚ where they may be seen evning or morning.
The light which we have gain’d, was giv’n us, not to
be ever staring on, but by it to discover onward things
more remote from our knowledge. It is not the un-

frocking osa Priest‚ the unmitring of a Biffl0p‚ and the re-

moving 111111 from off the Prqfhyterian shoulders that will
make 115 3 happy Nation, no, if other things as great in
the Church‚ and in the rule of life both economicall
and politicall be not lookt into and reform’ d, we have
lookt so long upon the blaze that Zuinglius and Calvin
hath beaeon’d up to 115, 11131 we are stark blind. There
be who perpetually complain of schisms and 10615, and
make it such 3 calamity that any 111311 diffents from their
maxims. 'Tis their own pride and ignorance which
causes the disturbing, who neither will hear with meek-
neS, nor can convince, yet 311 must be supprest which
is not found in their Syntagma. They are the troublerS,
they are the dividers of unity‚ who neglect and permit
¹not others to unite those diss‘ever'd peeces which
{are yet wanting to the body of Truth. To be still
116310111113 what we know not, by what we know, still
closing up truth to truth as we find it (for all her body
iskomogeneal, and proportionall) 11115 15 the golden rule
in Theology as well as in Arithmetick, and makes up the
{best harmony 111 3 Church3 not the forc' t and outward

11111011 of cold, and neutrall,and inwardly d1v1d ed minds.
