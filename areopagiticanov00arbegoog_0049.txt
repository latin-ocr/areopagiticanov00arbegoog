for scurrill Plautus whom he confesses to have bin
reading not long before 3 next to correct him only,
and let fo many more ancient F athers wax old in thofe
pleasant and florid studies without the lalh os such a
tutor-ing apparition ; insomuch that Bafil teaches how
some good use may be made os Margites a sportfull
Poem, not now extant, writ by Homcr‚· and why not
then of Morgante an Italian Romanze much to the
same purpose. But if it be agreed we shall be try'd by ,
vifions, there is a vision recorded by Eusebius far anci-
enter then this tale of Jerom to the nun Ezfstoclzium,
and befides has nothing of a feavor in it. Dionysius
Alexandrinus was about the year 240, a person of great
name in the Church for piety and learning, who had
wont to avail himself much against hereticks by being
conversant in their Books ; untill a certain Presbyter
laid it scrupuloussy to his conscience, how he durst
venture himselse among those defiling volumeS. The
avorthy man loath to give offence fell into a new de-
bate with himselse what was to be thought3 when sud-

that so averrs it, confirm'd him in these words : Read
any books what ever come to thy handS, for thou art
sufficient both to judge aright, and to examine each
matter. To this revelation he assented the sooner, as
he confesseS, because it was answerable to that of the
Apostle to the ThessalonianS, Prove all thingS, hold
fast that which is good. And he might have added
another remarkable saying of the same Author, To the
pure all things are pure, not only meats and drinkS, but
all kinde of knowledge whether os good or evill; the
knowledge cannot defile, nor consequently the bookS,
if the will and conscience be not defil'd. For books
are as meats and viands are, some of good, some of
evill substance ; and yet G-od in that unapocryphall
vifion, said without exception, Rise Peter, kill and eat,
leaving the choice to each mans discretion. Whole-
some meats to a vitiated stomack differ little or nothing
from unwholesome 5 and best books to a naughty mind
