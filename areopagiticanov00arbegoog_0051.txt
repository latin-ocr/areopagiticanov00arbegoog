more expedient to have told us what was unlawfull,
en what was wearisome. As for the burnmg of those
hefian books by St. Pauls converm, tis reply'd the
books were magick, the Syriack so renders them. It
was a privat aest, a voluntary act, and leaves us to
a voluntary imitation: the men in remor-se burnt those
books which were their own3 the Magistrat by this ex-
ample rs not appointed. these men practiz ’d the bookS,
another might perhaps have read them 1n fome sort use-
fully. Good and ·evill we know 1n the field of this World
grow up togetheralmost inseparably3 and the knowledge
of good is so involv' d and interwoven with the know-
ledge of evill, and in so many cunning resemblances
hardly to be disoern’d, that those confused seeds which
were impos’d on Psyche as an incess'ant labour to cull

Christian. Ι cannot praise a fugitive and cloister' d
svenne, unexercis’d and unbreath’ d, that never sallies
sout and sees her adversary‚ but ssinks out of the mee,
{where that immortall garland is to be run for, not
without dust and heat. Ass‘uredly we bring not inno·
hence into the world, we bring impurity much rather·
that which purifies us is triall, and triall ιε by what 1s
contrary. That vertue therefore which rs but a young-
3‘ling m th} contemplation of evilI, and knows not the
utmost that vice promises to her followerS, and rejects
it, is but a blank verme, not a pure3 her whiteneffe rs
