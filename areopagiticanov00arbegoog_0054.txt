what ever is hereticall or dissolute may quickly be con·
vey’d, and that evill manners are as perfestly learnt
without books a thousand other ways which cannot be
stopt, and evill doetrine not with books ‘can propagate,
except a teacher guide, which he might also doe with·
out writing‚ and so beyond prohibsting, I am not able
to unsold, how this cautelous cnterprise of licencing
can be exempted from the number of vain and impos-
slble attempts. And he who were pleasantly dispos'd‚
could not well avoid to lik’n it to the exploit of that
gallant man who thought to pound up the crows by
shutting his Parkgate. Besides another inconvenience,
if learned men be the first receivers out of books and
dispredders both of vice and error, how shall the
licencers themselves be confided in, unleffe we cau
conferr upon them, or they assume to themselves above
all others in the Laud, the grace of infallibility, and un-
corruptedness‘e‘l And again if it be true, that a wise man
like a good refiner can gather gold out of the drossiest vo-
lume, and that a fool will be a fool with the best book,
yea or without book, there is no reason that we should
deprive a wise man of any advantage to his wisdome,
while we seek to restrain srom a fool, that which being
restrain’d will be no hindrance to his folly. For if*
there should be so much exactneffe always us'd to i
keep that from him which is unfit for his reading, we
should in the judgement of Aristotle not only, but of
Salomon, and of our Saviour, not voutsafe him good ;
precepts‚ and by consequence not willingly·admit him l
to good bookS, as being certain that a wile man will
make better use of an idle pamphlet, then a fool will
do of sacred Scripture. ’Tis next alleg'd we must not
expose our selves to temptations without necesfity, and ὲ
next to that, not imploy our time in vain things.
To both these obje6fions one answer will serve, out
of the grounds already laid, that to all men such books
are not temptations, nor vanities 3 but usefull drugs and ff
materialls wherewith to temper and compote effective
and strong med'cins‚ which mans life cannot want. The Ἴ
