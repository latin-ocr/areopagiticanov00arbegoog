AREOPAGITICA. 7¹

of his ill united and unweildy brigade. And that we
are to hope better os all these supposed see’cs and schisms,
and that we shall not need that solicitude honest perhaps
though over timorous of them that vex in his behalf,
but shall laugh in the end, at those malicious applauders
of our differences‚ 1 have these reasons to perswade me.

First, when a City shall be as it were besieg'd and
blockt about, her navigable river infested‚ inrodes and
incurfions round, defiance and battell oft rumor'd to
be marching up ev'n to her walls, and suburb trencheS,
that then the people‚ or the greater part, more then
at other timeS, wholly tak'n up with the study of
highest and most important matters to be reform’d,
should be disputing, reasoning, reading, inventing, dis-
coursmg, ev'n to a rarity, and admiration, things not
before discourst or writt’n of, argues first a singular
good will, contentedneffe and confidence in your pru·
dent forefight‚ and safe govemment, Lords and Com-
mons 3 and from thence derives it sels to a gallant
bravery and well grounded contempt os their enemies‚
as if there were no small number of as great spirits
among uS, as his was, who when Rome was nigh be-
sieg'd by Hanibal, being in the C1ty‚ bought that peece
of ground at no cheap rate, whereon Hanibal himself
encampt his own regiment. Next it is a lively and
cherfull presage of our happy success‘e and vidiory.
For as in a body, when the blood is fresh, the spirits
pure and vigorous, not only to vital, but to rationall
facultieS‚ and those in the acutest, and the pertest
operations of wit and suttlety, it argues in what good
plight and constitution the body is, so when the cheer·
fulneffe os the people is so sprightly up, as that it haS,
not only wherewith to guard well its own freedom and
¹ safety, but to spare, and to bestow upon the solidest
and sublimest points of controversie, and new inven-
tion, it betok'n us not degenerated‚ nor drooping to a
fatall decay, but casting off the old and wrincl'd sszin
of corruption to outlive these pangs and wax young
ζ again, entring the glorious waies of Truth and prospe·
