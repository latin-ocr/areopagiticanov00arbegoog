rest, as children and childi1h men, who have not the art
¹ to qualifie and prepare these working mineralls, well
l may be exhorted to forbear, but hinder'd forcibly they
cannot be by all the licencing that Sainted Inquifition
could ever yet contrive 3 which is what I promis'd to
deliver next, That this order of licencing conduces
nothing to the end for which it was fram'd ; and hath
almost prevented me by being clear already while thus
much hath bin explaining. See the ingenuity of Truth,
who when she gets a free and willing hand, opens her
sels fasten then the pace of method and discours can
overtake her. It was the talk¹ which Ι began with, To
stiew that no Nation, or well instituted State, if they
valu'd books at all, did ever use this way os licencing3
and it might be answer'd, that this is a piece of pru-
dence lately discover’d‚ To which I return, that as it was
a thing ssight and obvious to think on, for if it had bin
difficult to finde out, there wanted not among them long
since, who suggested such a cours ; which they not fol·
lowing‚ leave us a pattem of their judgement, that it
was not the not knowing, but the not approving, which
was the cause of their not usmg it. Plato, a man of
high autority indeed, but least of all for his Common-
wealth, in the book of his laws, which no City ever yet
receiv'd, fed his fancie with making many edicts to his
ayrie Burgomasters, which they who otherwise admire
him, wish had bin rather buried and excus'd in the ‘
genial cups of an Academick night-fitting. By which
laws he seems to tolerat no kind of leaming‚ but by
unalterable decree‚ consisting most of practicall tradi-
tionS, to the attainment whereof a Library of smaller
, bulk then his own dialogues would be abundant. And
ἱ there also enac'ts that no Poet should so much as read
Ὺ Σῖῗέἕῷἰὶἶὲῗέἓιζέῗὲεἶῖιῖῗάἃῖἓῖιῗεζῗὲἰέἷῗὴέἷιῗῖἱὲῗ
s Plato meant this Law peculiarly to that Commonwealth
2 which he had imagin'd, and to no other, is evident.

Why was he not else a Law-giver to himself, but a

transgressor, and to be expell'd by his own Magistrats
