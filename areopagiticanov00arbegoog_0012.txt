the windes of doctrin were let loose to play upon the earth,
so Truth be ιιι the field, we do m jurioussy by liceneing and pro·
hibiting to misdoubt her strengh. Let her and Falshood grapple
who ever knew Truth put to the wors, in a free and open en·
counter. Her confuting ιε the best and surest supreffing. . .
W ho knows not that Truth is strong next to the Almighty3 fh
needs no policieS, no stratagem5‚ no licencings to make her vic·
toriou5‚ those are the shists and the defences that error us
against her power. ''⁴'‘

As we learn from his Second quence—written te
years after the present work—the singularly conceptiv
mind of Milton had grouped into one cycle subject
of no apparent immediate connection. Episcopacy,
Divorce‚ Education‚ Freedom of the Individual, Free
dom of the PrefS, had, to his mind, one point of iden
tity and contat& one conne6ting link,—Liberty.
This, a cardinal thought of his entire life, seems to
have almost overpowered him, as he saw the break-u
of the system of the leorouglz, the nation uprifing again
the tyranny of a few, and laying—for all coming ages
—the foundations of that religious, civil, and domestic
Liberty, which it is our happiness to enjoy.

Of that great cycle, the ‘Areopagitica’ occupies bu
a subordinate part, Milton claffifying it under domestic
liberty with divorce and education. He there also

tells uS, his purpose 1n writing it. —

‘⁴1 wrote my Areopagitica, in order to deliver the press from
the restraints with which it was encumbered; that the power
determining what was true and what was false, what ought to be
published and what to be supprefl'ed, might no longer be en·
trusted to a few illiterate and illiberal individuals, who refused
their sanction to any work which contained views or sentiments
at all above the level of the vulgar superstition.’'†

The following Orders, &c., have been reprinted;
partly to give the groundwork of fact to Milton's argu-
ment; partly to show the strong hand and the blunt
mind of our Ancestors in respe& to the Press 3 and
partly to affist to a more perse& realization of the an·
mgonistic ideas and circumstances, in the midst. of
which, Milton conceived the ‘ Areopagitica‚’ and so to
render more apparent its beauty and originality.
