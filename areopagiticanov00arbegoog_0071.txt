3' trading St nomas in his vestry, and adde to boot St.
ἵ Μανίὶη, and St Hugh, have not within their hallow’d
÷ limits more vendible ware of all sorts ready made:
κ so that penury he never need sear of Pulpit pro
vifion, having where so plenteoussy to refresh his ma·
ἶ gazin. But if his rear and flanks be not impal’d, if
his back dore be not secur'd by the rigid licencer, but
that a bold book may now and then issue forth, ano
give the affault to some of his old collee‘dons in their
trenches, it will concern him then to keep waking, to
stand in watch, to set good guards and sentinells about
his receiv'd opinionS, to walk the round and counter-

judiciouS, learned, and of a conscience, for ought we
know, as good as theirs that taught us what we know,
shall not privily from house to house, which is more
dangerouS, but openly by writing publish to the world
what his opinion is, what his reasonS, and wherefore
that which is now thought cannot be found. Christ
urg’d it as wherewith to justifie himself, that he preacht
in publick ; yet writing is more publick then preaching ;
and more eafie to refutation, if need be, there being so
= many whose busmeffe and profeffion meerly it is, to be
the champions of Truth 3 which if they neglect, what
1 can be imputed but their ssoth, or inabilty?

Ἴ Thus much we are hinder'd and dis-inur’d by this

cours of licencing towards the true knowledge of what

we seem to know. For how much it hurts and hinders

the licencers themselves in the calling of their Min·
