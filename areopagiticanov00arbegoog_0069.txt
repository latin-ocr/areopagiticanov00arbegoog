and complexion. T ruth is compar'd in Scripture to a
stoeaming fountain3 if her waters flow not in a perpet·
uall progreflion, they fick’n into a muddy pool of con·
fonnity and tradition. A man may be a heretick in
the truth3 and if he beleeve things only because his
Pastor sayes s0‚ or the Affembly so determins, without
