AREOPA GJTJCA. 77

goe on, some new enlightn'd steps in the discovery os
truth. For such is the order of Gods enlightning his
Church, to dispense and deal out by degrees his bearn,
so as our earthly eyes may best sustain it. Neither
is God appointed and confin’d‚ where and out of what
place these his chosen shall be first heard to speak; for
he sees not as man seeS, chooses not as man chooseS‚
lest we should devote our selves again to set places, and
assemblies, and outward callings of men 3 planting our
saith one while in the old Convocation house, and
another while in the Chappell at Westminster ς, when
all the saith and religion that shall be there canoniz'd,
is not sufficient without plain convincement, and the
charity os patient instruction to supple the least bruise
of conscience, to edifie the meanest Christian, who de-
fires to walk in the Spirit, and not in the letter os
human trust, sor all the number os voices that can be
there made, no though Harry the 7. himself there,
with all his leige tombs about him, should lend
them voices from the dead, to swell their number.
And is the men be erroneous who appear to be
the leading schiimaticks, what witholds us but our
ssoth, our sels-will, and distrust in the right cause, that
we doe not give them gentle meetings and gentle dis-
miffionS, that we debate not and examin the matter
throughly with liberall and frequent audience3 if not
sor their sakeS, yet sor our own? seeing no man who
hath tasted learning, but will conseffe the many waies of
profiting by those who not contented with stale receits
are able to manage, and set forth new pofitions to the
world. And were they but as the dust and cinders of
our feet, so long as in that notion they may serve to
polisti and brighten the armoury os Truth, ev' n sor that
respeet the y were not utterly to be cast away. But if
they be of those whom God hath fitted sor the speciall
use of these times with eminent and ample gistS, and
those perhaps neither among the PriestS, nor among
the Pharisees, and we in the hast os a precipitant zeal
shall make no distin &iombut resolve to stop their mouths,
