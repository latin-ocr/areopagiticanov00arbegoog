because we fear they come with new and dangerous
opinionS, as we commonly sore-judge them ere we un·
derstand thern, no lefl‘e then woe to us, while thinking ·
thus to defend the Gospel, we are found the persecutorS.

There have bin not a few fince the beginning of this
Parlament, both of the Presbytery and others who by
their unlicen't books to the contempt of an Imprimatur
first broke that triple ice clung about our heartS, and
taught the people to see day: I hope that none of those
were the perswaders to renew upon us this bondage which
they themselves have wrought so much good by con·
temning. But if neither the check that Moses gave to
young sestam, nor the countermand which our Saviour
gave to young John, who was so ready to prohibit those
whom he thought unlicenc't, be not anough to admonish
our Elders how unacceptable to God their testy mood

active at suppressing‚ it would be no unequall distribu-
tion in the nrst place to suppreffe the-suppressors them-
selves 3 whom the change of their condition hath puft

no book be Printed‚ unlefl‘e the Printers and the Au thors
name, or at least the Printers be register'd.⁶ Those which
otherwise corne forth, is they be found mischievous and
libellous, the fire and the executioner will be the time·
liestand the most effectuallremedy‚ that mans prevention
can use. For this c‘zutlzentic Spanish policy of licencing
bookS, if I have said ought, will prove the most unlicenc't
book it self within a short while 3 and was the immediat
image of a Stat-chamber decree⁷ to that purpose made
